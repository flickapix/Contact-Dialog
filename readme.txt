Enables display of an AJAX driven contact form when a user clicks on links with a specified class.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to display a form when users click on links inside of elements with a class you specify. The plugin uses a custom version of jQuery UI on the front end, and does not address situations where Javascript is turned off. It does provide a simple, attractive contact form inside of a modal dialog box.
